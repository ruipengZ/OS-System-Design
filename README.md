# OS-System-Design
This is a simple design of an OS system which includes management of process and resource

The main features are:
1. Handling process control, such as process creation and cancellation, process state transition
2. Handling process scheduling based on priority scheduling algorithm, simulate clock interruption, and schedule in the same priority process using time slice rotation scheduling algorithm; 
3. Handling resource allocation and release, and complete the synchronization between processes. At the same time, the manager can read the user command from the user terminal or the specified file, interpret the user command through the test shell module, convert the user command to the specific operation of process and resource control, and output the execution result to the terminal or the specified file
